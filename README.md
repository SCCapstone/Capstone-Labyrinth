# Capstone-Labyrinth

This is the README.md for the Capstone Labyrinth Maze game, designed for desktop use. You can read our [Project Description](https://github.com/SCCapstone/Capstone-Labyrinth/wiki/Project-Description) for more information.

## External Requirements

The Capstone Labyrinth Game comes will all necessary libraries. No external requirements.

## Setup  

We used the Visual Studio 19 IDE to compile and build our game. All information on how to build within Visual Studio 19 can be found in Microsoft's [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/walkthrough-building-an-application?view=vs-2019#build-the-application).

When pulling and building the source code, the Game.exe should build in the Game/ directory. If this is not the case, simply build the project, and place Game.exe in the Game/ directory.

## Running

Dowload the source code (.zip), navigate to the Game Folder, and run the Game.exe to play.
