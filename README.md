# Capstone-Labyrinth  
The Capstone Labyrinth is a desktop pixel-art game. You are placed in the center of the Labyrinth, with the objective of slaying the 4 monsterous bosses hidden in it's depths. But conquerors beware...you are not the only one who wanders the Labyrinth's halls. You can read our [Project Description](https://github.com/SCCapstone/Capstone-Labyrinth/wiki/Project-Description) for more information.

## External Requirements

The Capstone Labyrinth Game comes will all necessary libraries. No external requirements.

## Setup  

Our team used the Visual Studio 19 IDE to compile and build our game. All information on how to build within Visual Studio 19 can be found in Microsoft's [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/walkthrough-building-an-application?view=vs-2019#build-the-application).

When pulling and building the source code, the Game.exe should build in the Game/ directory. If this is not the case, simply build the project, and place Game.exe in the Game/ directory.  

The user should not have to build the project within Visual Studio 19, as the latest release will include the most recent release build. Please refer to the Running portion for game execution.  

## Running  

Steps:  
1. Download .zip and extract into place of your choosing
2. Download Game.exe, and place in Game/ directory of extracted .zip file
3. Windows will ask if you want to run .exe anyway, click "More Info", then "Run Anyway"  
4. Enjoy!
