# Capstone-Labyrinth

This is the README.md for the Capstone Labyrinth Maze game, designed for desktop use. You can read our [Project Description](https://github.com/SCCapstone/Capstone-Labyrinth/wiki/Project-Description) for more information.

## External Requirements

The Capstone Labyrinth Game comes will all necessary libraries. No external requirements.

## Setup  

We used the Visual Studio 19 IDE to compile and build our game. All information on how to build within Visual Studio 19 can be found in Microsoft's [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/walkthrough-building-an-application?view=vs-2019#build-the-application).

When pulling and building the source code, the Game.exe should build in the Game/ directory. If this is not the case, simply build the project, and place Game.exe in the Game/ directory.  

The user should not have to build the project within Visual Studio 19, as the latest release will include the most recent release build. Please refer to the Setup portion for game execution.  

## Running  

Steps:  
1. Download .zip and extract into place of your choosing
2. Download Game.exe, and place in Game/ directory of extracted .zip file
3. Windows will ask if you want to run .exe anyway, click "More Info", then "Run Anyway"  
4. Enjoy!
